I'm just gonna fall off the door. Okay. Hello everybody. And I'm Sarah Project Manager. And this is our first meeting. Okay, this is our agenda. We will do some stuff, get to know each other a bit better. We'll come to each other. Then we'll go do two training. Talk about Project Plan, discuss our own ideas, everything. And we'll go 25 minutes to do that as far as I can understand. Now we're developing a local church, we're already know. We want it to be original, something that's up. People haven't thought of, it's not iron shops. They're trying to be appealing to a wide market, but not a hunk of metal. And user-friendly, granny, to kids, maybe even creatures should be able to use it. Okay. First is the functional design. This is where we all go after their individual work. What needs need to be fulfilled by the product. What effects the product has to have. And how it's actually going to do that. Conceptual design. What we're thinking, how it's going to go. And then the detail design, how we're actually going to put it into practice and make it work. Okay, right. We're going to practice with the pens. And draw our favorite animal on the whiteboard, our reference. And some of the characteristics of that animal. So, okay. Let me just space grab one. Okay. And I'm not going to ask you to guess. I'm going to tell you that it's with free of tiger. And I see them as majestic. And independent. And pride. No. We'd like to come next. Okay. We're sure we got this going from. Okay. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make. Kind of talk. Yeah. It's actually sitting. So. Sorry. It's sitting. It's not standing. Okay. I see it as one thing. It's very supportive. It's your best friend in your. You can talk to a dog. It can be a best friend. It doesn't discriminate between you. You know. Based on what you are. Second it's. Part of it's got intuition. I mean, dogs can sometimes make out between a thief and a person. So basically these are the three unique features. I think belong to a dog. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Sorry. Please leave me a space. leave me a space at the bottom on the top. Oh right. We're standing on a chair. Well since you guys have chosen their ones I want to stay. Okay. Have some fun with the dog. I'm going to be here. And also my drawing skill isn't that great. Well as you can see the quality of the work today, I think it's like standing with good speed. Okay, now I'm going to have to change what it will. Or it's originally going to be because that looks like a beak. Crocodile? Yeah, it can be a crocodile. It can be a crocodile. Well it was the best. It was an attempt to a T-Rex. And then it's so changing to a pelican. But it can be a crocodile. That's lovely. Yeah, and I think on the spot of things that is scary, strong. Yeah, that's funny. I think I'm very impressed with your artistic skills. Mine's a dreadful. Oops, this is now coming apart. I just put the top thing. I'll hold that click. I'll hold it on. Oops. Oh dear. What happened there? I'm going to go out. Hopefully that'll stay on 200 version. Okay. Again, this is off the top of my head. I was going to do a big cat too. I don't do it. It doesn't look like what I wanted to be. It's not a vampire bat, honestly. Somewhere there's a body behind. That's my dreadful. That's the worst. Yeah, it's meant to be an eagle. You can tell it's a flying animal. Could have been a eagle. I never thought of a eagle. An eagle. Again, I'm thinking on my feet, goodness. It's what they're also independent. I'll put that one down again. Da-da-da. Um. I get a go. Da-da-pan. Indepandant. Right. Did you say they're good at golf? Yeah. Are they? You go. I'm not good at golf. I'll see. They're quite free-spirited. Flying around everywhere. Doing their own thing. And birds of prey aren't like, oh dear. Interested. Interested. There we go. That pen's going to be okay. Okay. That was fine. Fine. That was fine. Fine. Fine, that's why we've got a seven-pi-cept 25 years. Which I don't actually know what. That is the time to tell any ideas. So what might be the idea? One point four year old would make a fall into something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah, about 17. So I'm talking about something. Sounds like a little bit. Sounds like a little bit. I think so. Should we be making notes of this? We can just refer to this later. I think so. I think that I'd be able to put up. Or I think we have a shared folder. Having said that though, if you want to get one of those, the ones on the market, the main list, they're about 20 pounds anyway. Right. Yeah. We have to say one. So suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price. Or is it going to make our product look like a GPT field? Yeah. Production costs at 12.50. So the huge margin half of the selling price is taking that by building it. And profit aim is 50 million euros. Which is it? In our first year. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I presume so. Mm. I love it. You've got market range international. And you did see earlier it's got to be accessible and usable by sort of all age groups. Just not focusing on business market, any particular thing. It's everyone, user friendly to everyone. Okay. Big target group. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think we have to. I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that. Making that key point. Just that it's going to be an international market like Australia, America, things like that. Okay. Wateryear experiences in the world control. I've got, we got, we had three videos, a TV and sort of amp thing all set up. So we got one of the universal remote controls. Yeah. I think that you program each of you things into. But that kept losing the signals. So we'd have to reprogram it every now and again. I think it was quite a cheapie as well. Yeah. That might have some to do with it. But that was quite good about the e-cups. You saw the ones you have. You have six from out controls. You want to include everything into one like. Yeah. I experienced the only being being given the remote control with the object I buy. Not doing any tampering with it and programming. Using it to program TV videos and things. But basically on or volume up and down channel one to that basic function. I don't think I could go any further with it than that. So it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well. Yeah. The main thing, that's the main stuff anyway. I mean, and you don't want to, I hate, I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words, thing what they all do. I'm just sitting there searching for the tailoring text button. And the silly things that you don't necessarily understand. Simple to mention, understand the details. When you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something. To the other functions when you can do sound or option. Recording things like that inside it. Because it doesn't make when you pick it up. It doesn't make it become complicated to look at it. Of the yes, when you're doing it. Actually, that just raises a point. I wonder who our design people think. But you know on a mobile phone, you can press the key and it gives you a menu. It's got a menu display. I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control. Like the user. So you've got a little LCD display. I was thinking on the same lines view. Instead of having too many buttons and make it complicated for the user. Maybe having LCD display or something like that. Like a mobile with many. And with menus. And if it's somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone, people might find it easier to browse and navigate elsewhere. Yeah. What about the old generation? About granny and granddad? I don't understand. My granddad can answer his mobile phone. You're getting even dream of texting or something like that. Can he program his remote controller? Is he basic without two? I don't think they take anything. My granddad, that's your better than me using teletext. Right. So that's a problem regardless of any design modifications you come up with. Yeah. That's going to be a problem anyway with the older generation. Perhaps. And that's another issue over-tanker. Why just needs three. As long as it's self-intuitive and you can work out why everything's doing. Because I mean, menus on telemetes, phones now that talk goldies, pictures and stuff, which makes it fairly obvious for your tragedy. I don't know. I don't know how. I don't like the new phones that kind of got a window based running system. I find it really confusing. I kept getting lost in the phone. I have no good on you one, but my friend go on you one. Let's try and do things a bit. And I just kept getting lost. But that's just me. Yeah. I don't know how. But 25 or 12 years, 50, how much. Excellent screen if you get. You'd have to so. Keep it down to them. Black and white else. The thing in here. Is it possible that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books. Obviously it just plays last on the screen. It just plays last on the screen, but as long as they can read it that's the main thing. Yeah. Or what about kind of a dual function in that you've got the basic buttons just for your play value program things. And also, and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures of the symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that. The other thing is just tucking into mobile phone design features again. You have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top, your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the flip over. I think that's a constant. Yeah. Yeah. How much we're going to know by it's might save up with a space and sort of looking bulk-cave my glass models. Yeah. It might have a constant implications. And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone. It can still be like weight plastic, you know, something that's easily molded and produced. Sorry, I'm trying to even know where to take care of my phone. Right. Okay, we've got to have a phone for the next meeting, so we're going to go off and do our individual things. I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and get another fantastic project. Just a quick thing about the... What you're saying about the doesn't need to be fashionable. So if I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the... We put the fashion into electronics. Oh, really? I think the whole design thing might be... Sure. I mean, you can still have plastic and it look quite good, but... Yeah. I mean, it doesn't have to be... But that was my main point. We don't have to use metal. I don't know if using plastic doesn't make it cheap or approximate word. Yeah. I agree with you. Yeah. I mean, the sky will look in your eyes and they're kind of molded and look a bit different. And then the telly-west will look controlled, so silver plastic, which I... looks a bit slotted. So yeah, I guess that's okay. Okay. So let's break out there. Okay. Okay.

Yeah.\n"]}],"source":["import whisper\n","\n","# try \"tiny\" or \"base\" instead of \"small\" to speed up\n","model = whisper.load_model(\"tiny\")\n","\n","result = model.transcribe(\"ES2004a.wav\")\n","print(\"Transcript:\\n\", result[\"text\"])\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":42259,"status":"ok","timestamp":1758821037931,"user":{"displayName":"Sairishika Mora","userId":"16598368547470531640"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"fMVueev0QbQ2","outputId":"9970fa61-4af5-491c-d7af-3f5d445fefd3"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement already satisfied: pydub in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (0.25.1)\n","--- Chunk 0 ---\n"," We're not like to do the lights.

Then we'll go do tool training, talk about the project plan, discuss our own ideas and everything. And we've got 25 minutes to do that as far as I can understand. Now, we're developing a welcome tool, which you probably already know. We want it to be original, something that people haven't thought of. It's not out in the shops. Trendy, appealing to a wide market, but not a hunk of metal. And user-friendly, granny's, two kids, maybe even preachers, should be able to use it. Okay. First is the functional design.

It's not standing. Okay. I see it as one thing. It's very supportive. It's your best friend in you. You can talk to a dog. It can be a best friend. It can discriminate between you based on what you are. Second, it's loyal. And third thing, it's got intuition. Means dogs can sometimes make out between a thief and a person. So, basically, these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Please leave me a space at the bottom. I'm little. All right. We're standing on a chair. Well, since you guys have chosen their ones I wanted to do. Okay. Have some good things about a dog that you can. And also my drawing skill isn't that great. Well, as you can see, the quality of the work today. I think it's that standing we're good. Okay, now I'm going to have to change what it was originally going to be. It looks like a beak now. So. Crocodile. Yeah, it can be a crocodile. It can be a crocodile. Well, it was it was the first. Firstly, it was an attempt to a T-regs. And then it sort of changed into a pelican, but it can be a crook. Yeah. And I have to think on the spot of things that is scary. Strong. Yeah, that's funny. I think I'm very impressed with your artistic skills. Mine's a dreadful. This is now coming apart. Let me just put the top in. I'll just hold it on. Oh, dear. What happened there? I'm going to have to take a look at the top of my head. I'm going to have to take a look at the top of my head. I'm going to have to take a look at the top of my head. Hopefully that'll stay on 200 versions. I'm not a vampire, but honestly. Somewhere there's a body behind. That's my dreadful, that's the worst yet. It's meant to be an eagle. Right. You can tell it's a flying animal. Could have been a seagull. I never thought of a seagull. An eagle. Again, I'm thinking on my feet. Goodness. I suppose they're also independent. I'd put that one down again. I'm not a good at golf. I'm not a good at golf. I'll say they're quite free-spirited. Flying around everywhere. Doing their own thing. And birds of prey, aren't they? Oh, dear. Intrappered. There we go. I hope that pen's going to be okay. Okay. That was fine. Right. Finance-wise, we've got a selling price at 25 euros, which I don't actually know what. That is in pounds, at all. Any ideas? 17. One point four-year-old would make a bond or something? Yeah, yeah, saying that. 17. 17 pounds. Okay. Should we be making notes of this? We can just refer to this later. I think so. I'll be able to put the app on a television show. Having said that, that's a good idea. I think so. I think so. I think it's a show. Having said that, though, if you want to get one of those the ones on the market, the moment this.\n","--- Chunk 2 ---\n"," there about 20 pounds anyway. Right. Yeah, we have small ones. So I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price. Or is it going to make our product look cheapy, cheapy, opsy? Yeah, production costs at 1250. So, for the huge margin. Half of the selling prices taken out by building it. And profit A is 50 million euros, which is there. You know, first year? Yeah. Yeah. I presume so. You've got market range international. And you did see earlier it's got to be accessible and usable by all age groups. We're not focusing on business market, any particular thing. It's everyone, user friends, everyone. Okay. Big target group. Yeah. I don't think we have to, I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that. Making that key point. Just that it's going to be an international market like Australia, America, things like that. Okay. Wateryear experiences in film and controls. I mean, I've got, we've got, we've got three videos, a TV and sort of amp thing all set up. So, we've got one of the universal remote controls. Yeah. And the program, each of you are saying is empty. But that kept losing the signals. So, we have to reprogram it every now and again. I think it was quite cheapy as well. Yeah. That might have had something to do with it. But that was quite good. The fact that you could. You sold the ones you had. You had a lot of things from out controls. Right. You want to integrate everything into one like. Yeah. My experience has only been given the remote control with the object I buy. Not doing any tampering with it and programming. Using it to program TV videos and things. But basically on or volume up and down. Channel one to that basic function. I don't think I could go any further with it. Than that. So, I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well. Yeah. That's the main stuff anyway. And you don't want to. I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words to think what they all do. I'm just sitting there searching for the teletext button. And the symbols that you don't necessarily understand. Symbols are meant to understand that you don't. When you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up for something to the other functions when you can do sound or recording things like that inside it. Because it doesn't make it up, it doesn't make it be complicated to look at. Yes, what you're doing. Actually, that just raises a point. I wonder what our design people think. But you know on a mobile phone, you can press the key and it gives you a menu. It's got a menu display. I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control like the user. Maybe you should see a little LCD display. I was thinking of the same lines you instead of having too many buttons and make it complicated for the user. Maybe have an LCD display or something like that like a mobile. With menus. And with menus. And if it's somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone, people might find it easier to browse and navigate also. What about the older generation? What about Granny and Grandad? I'm going to say that my gradad can answer his mobile phone. You couldn't even dream of texting or something like that. Can he program his remote controller? Is he basic with that too? I don't think they're taping. Yeah. My grandad thought she better than me using teletax. So that's a problem regardless of any design modifications you come up with. That's going to be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps. And that's another issue overtackled up. It just needs to be as long as it's self intuitive and you can work out why everything's doing. Because I mean menus on sort of neat phones now that go all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do. I don't know how. I don't like the new phones that kind of got a windows based running system. I find it really confusing. I kept getting lost in the phone. I've not got a new one but my friend got a new one. And I'm trying to do things with it. And I just kept getting lost. But that's just me. Yeah. I don't know how for 25 or 12 euros 50 how much of an excellent screen you could get. You'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white LCD thing.\n","--- Chunk 3 ---\n"," For the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for a large print, like you do in large print books.

What we're thinking, how it's going to go. And then the detailed design, how we're actually going to put it into practice and make it work. Okay. Right. We're going to practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the whiteboard agrofirst. And some of the characteristics of that animal. So... Okay. All this space for everyone else. We're running it, please. Okay. I'm not going to ask you to guess. I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger. And I see them as majestic. And independent. And proud. Now we'd like to go next. Okay. Wish. Got. Is this confirm? There you go, pal. Thank you. Maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make.\n","--- Chunk 1 ---\n"," I kind of talk. Yeah. It's actually sitting. So, it's sitting. It's not standing. Okay. I see it as one thing. It's very supportive. It's your best friend in you. You can talk to a dog. It can be a best friend. It can discriminate between you based on what you are. Second, it's loyal. And third thing, it's got intuition. Means dogs can sometimes make out between a thief and a person. So, basically, these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Please leave me a space at the bottom. I'm little. All right. We're standing on a chair. Well, since you guys have chosen their ones I wanted to do. Okay. Have some good things about a dog that you can. And also my drawing skill isn't that great. Well, as you can see, the quality of the work today is them. I think it's that standing we're good. Okay, now I'm going to have to change what it was originally going to be because it looks like a beak now. So. Crocodile. Yeah, it can be a crocodile. It can be a crocodile. Well, it was it was the first. Firstly, it was an attempt to a tea rags. And then it sort of changed into a pelican, but it can be a cro... That's lovely. Yeah. And I have to think on the spot of the things that it is. Scary. Strong. Yeah, that's funny. I think. Okay. I'm very impressed with your artistic skills. Mine's a dreadful. Oops, this is now coming apart. Let me just put the top in. I'll put that click in. I'll just... I'll hold it on. Oh dear. What happened there? Technical help. Hopefully that'll stay on. 200 versions. Okay. Again, this is off the top of my head. I was going to do a big cat too. And dear, it doesn't look like what I wanted to be. It's not a vampire bat, honestly. And somewhere there's a body behind. That's my dreadful. That's the worst yet. It's meant to be an eagle. Right. You can tell it's a flying animal. Could have been a seagull. I never thought of a seagull. An eagle. Again, I'm thinking on my feet. Goodness. I suppose they're also independent. I'd put that one down again. Independent. Independent. Right. Did you say they're good at golf? Yeah. Oh, they're good. Oh, right. I'm not good at golf. I'll say they're quite free-spirited. Flying around everywhere. Doing their own thing. And birds of prey, aren't they? Oh dear. Intrappered. There we go. I hope that pen's going to be okay. Whoops. Okay. That was fun. Right. Finance-wise, we've got a selling price at 25 euros, which I don't actually know what that is. At all. Any ideas? 17. 17. One point four. You know what would make a bomb or something? Yeah, yeah, saying that. 17. 17. 17. 17 pounds. Okay. Should we be making notes of this? We can just refer to this later. I think so. I'd be able to put the app on a kind of shared folder. Having said that though, if you want to get one of those, the ones on the market, the moment this.\n","--- Chunk 2 ---\n"," there about 20 pounds anyway. Right. Yeah, we have small ones. So I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price. Or is it going to make our product look cheapy, cheapy, opsy? Yeah, production costs at 1250. So, for the huge margin. Half of the selling prices taken out by building it. And profit A is 50 million euros, which is there. You know, first year? Yeah. Yeah. I presume so. You've got market range international. And you did see earlier it's got to be accessible and usable by all age groups. We're not focusing on business market, any particular thing. It's everyone, user friends, everyone. Okay. Big target group. Yeah. I don't think we have to, I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that. Making that key point. Just that it's going to be an international market like Australia, America, things like that. Okay. Wateryear experiences in film and controls. I mean, I've got, we've got, we've got three videos, a TV and sort of amp thing all set up. So, we've got one of the universal remote controls. Yeah. And the program, each of you are saying is empty. But that kept losing the signals. So, we have to reprogram it every now and again. I think it was quite cheapy as well. Yeah. That might have had something to do with it. But that was quite good. The fact that you could. You sold the ones you had. You had a lot of things from out controls. Right. You want to integrate everything into one like. Yeah. My experience has only been given the remote control with the object I buy. Not doing any tampering with it and programming. Using it to program TV videos and things. But basically on or volume up and down. Channel one to that basic function. I don't think I could go any further with it. Than that. So, I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well. Yeah. That's the main stuff anyway. And you don't want to. I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words to think what they all do. I'm just sitting there searching for the teletext button. And the symbols that you don't necessarily understand. Symbols are meant to understand that you don't. When you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up for something to the other functions when you can do sound or recording things like that inside it. Because it doesn't make it up, it doesn't make it be complicated to look at. Yes, what you're doing. Actually, that just raises a point. I wonder what our design people think. But you know on a mobile phone, you can press the key and it gives you a menu. It's got a menu display. I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control like the user. Maybe you should see a little LCD display. I was thinking of the same lines you instead of having too many buttons and make it complicated for the user. Maybe have an LCD display or something like that like a mobile. With menus. And with menus. And if it's somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone, people might find it easier to browse and navigate also. What about the older generation? What about Granny and Grandad? I'm going to say that my grader can answer his mobile phone. He couldn't even dream of texting or something like that. Can he program his remote controller? Is he basic with that too? I don't think they're taping. Yeah. My grandad thought she better than me using teletax. So that's a problem regardless of any design modifications you come up with. That's going to be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps. And that's another issue overtackled up. It just needs to be as long as it's self intuitive and you can work out why everything's doing. Because I mean menus on sort of neat phones now that go all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do. I don't know how. I don't like the new phones that kind of got a windows based running system. I find it really confusing. I kept getting lost in the phone. I've not got a new one but my friend got a new one. And I'm trying to do things with it. And I just kept getting lost. But that's just me. Yeah. I don't know how for 25 or 12 euros 50 how much of an excellent screen you could get. You'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white LCD thing.\n","--- Chunk 3 ---\n"," For the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for a large print, like you do in large print books. Obviously it displays less on the screen, it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing. What about kind of a dual function in that you've got the basic buttons just for your play volume program things. And also a menu to go into with obvious pictures, obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that. The other thing is just tucking into mobile phone design features again. You could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the flip over. I think that's a cost thing. I don't know how much we're going to know about. It might save a bit of space instead of looking bulkier, it might look small. It might have some cost implications. And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone. It can still be lightweight plastic, you know, something that's easily molded and produced. Sorry, I'm trading on your territory guys. Right, okay, we've got half an hour for the next meeting so we're all going to go off and do our individual things. I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and do it again. And I get to do another fantastic presentation. Just a quick thing about the, what you're saying about the, doesn't need to be fashionable. So I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the, we put the fashion into electronics. I think the whole design thing might be hard to find. Sure. You can still have plastic and it looks quite good. Yeah, I mean it doesn't have to be, that, you know, that was my main point. We do have to use metal. I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper, I presume it would. Yeah, yeah. I mean the sky remote controls have, they're kind of molded and look a bit different than the telewest remote control. So the plastic looks a bit smarter. So yeah, I guess that's the stuff. Okay. So let's break up there. Okay. Okay. So see you in half an hour. Do we go back to our, our, our things? Yeah.\n","\n","Final Transcript:\n","  We're not like to do the lights.

We're running it, please. Okay. I'm not going to ask you to guess. I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger. And I see them as majestic. And independent. And proud. Now we'd like to go next. Okay. Wish. Got. Is this confirm? There you go, pal. Thank you. Maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make.  I kind of talk. Yeah. It's actually sitting. So, it's sitting. It's not standing. Okay. I see it as one thing. It's very supportive. It's your best friend in you. You can talk to a dog. It can be a best friend. It can discriminate between you based on what you are. Second, it's loyal. And third thing, it's got intuition. Means dogs can sometimes make out between a thief and a person. So, basically, these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Please leave me a space at the bottom. I'm little. All right. We're standing on a chair. Well, since you guys have chosen their ones I wanted to do. Okay. Have some good things about a dog that you can. And also my drawing skill isn't that great. Well, as you can see, the quality of the work today is them. I think it's that standing we're good. Okay, now I'm going to have to change what it was originally going to be because it looks like a beak now. So. Crocodile. Yeah, it can be a crocodile. It can be a crocodile. Well, it was it was the first. Firstly, it was an attempt to a tea rags. And then it sort of changed into a pelican, but it can be a cro... That's lovely. Yeah. And I have to think on the spot of the things that it is. Scary. Strong. Yeah, that's funny. I think. Okay. I'm very impressed with your artistic skills. Mine's a dreadful. Oops, this is now coming apart. Let me just put the top in. I'll put that click in. I'll just... I'll hold it on. Oh dear. What happened there? Technical help. Hopefully that'll stay on. 200 versions. Okay. Again, this is off the top of my head. I was going to do a big cat too. And dear, it doesn't look like what I wanted to be. It's not a vampire bat, honestly. And somewhere there's a body behind. That's my dreadful. That's the worst yet. It's meant to be an eagle. Right. You can tell it's a flying animal. Could have been a seagull. I never thought of a seagull. An eagle. Again, I'm thinking on my feet. Goodness. I suppose they're also independent. I'd put that one down again. Independent. Independent. Right. Did you say they're good at golf? Yeah. Oh, they're good. Oh, right. I'm not good at golf. I'll say they're quite free-spirited. Flying around everywhere. Doing their own thing. And birds of prey, aren't they? Oh dear. Intrappered. There we go. I hope that pen's going to be okay. Whoops. Okay. That was fun. Right. Finance-wise, we've got a selling price at 25 euros, which I don't actually know what that is. At all. Any ideas? 17. 17. One point four. You know what would make a bomb or something? Yeah, yeah, saying that. 17. 17. 17. 17 pounds. Okay. Should we be making notes of this? We can just refer to this later. I think so. I'd be able to put the app on a kind of shared folder. Having said that though, if you want to get one of those, the ones on the market, the moment this.  there about 20 pounds anyway. Right. Yeah, we have small ones. So I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price. Or is it going to make our product look cheapy, cheapy, opsy? Yeah, production costs at 1250. So, for the huge margin. Half of the selling prices taken out by building it. And profit A is 50 million euros, which is there. You know, first year? Yeah. Yeah. I presume so. You've got market range international. And you did see earlier it's got to be accessible and usable by all age groups. We're not focusing on business market, any particular thing. It's everyone, user friends, everyone. Okay. Big target group. Yeah. I don't think we have to, I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that. Making that key point. Just that it's going to be an international market like Australia, America, things like that. Okay. Wateryear experiences in film and controls. I mean, I've got, we've got, we've got three videos, a TV and sort of amp thing all set up. So, we've got one of the universal remote controls. Yeah. And the program, each of you are saying is empty. But that kept losing the signals. So, we have to reprogram it every now and again. I think it was quite cheapy as well. Yeah. That might have had something to do with it. But that was quite good. The fact that you could. You sold the ones you had. You had a lot of things from out controls. Right. You want to integrate everything into one like. Yeah. My experience has only been given the remote control with the object I buy. Not doing any tampering with it and programming. Using it to program TV videos and things. But basically on or volume up and down. Channel one to that basic function. I don't think I could go any further with it. Than that. So, I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well. Yeah. That's the main stuff anyway. And you don't want to. I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words to think what they all do. I'm just sitting there searching for the teletext button. And the symbols that you don't necessarily understand. Symbols are meant to understand that you don't. When you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up for something to the other functions when you can do sound or recording things like that inside it. Because it doesn't make it up, it doesn't make it be complicated to look at. Yes, what you're doing. Actually, that just raises a point. I wonder what our design people think. But you know on a mobile phone, you can press the key and it gives you a menu. It's got a menu display. I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control like the user. Maybe you should see a little LCD display. I was thinking of the same lines you instead of having too many buttons and make it complicated for the user. Maybe have an LCD display or something like that like a mobile. With menus. And with menus. And if it's somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone, people might find it easier to browse and navigate also. What about the older generation? What about Granny and Grandad? I'm going to say that my grader can answer his mobile phone. He couldn't even dream of texting or something like that. Can he program his remote controller? Is he basic with that too? I don't think they're taping. Yeah. My grandad thought she better than me using teletax. So that's a problem regardless of any design modifications you come up with. That's going to be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps. And that's another issue overtackled up. It just needs to be as long as it's self intuitive and you can work out why everything's doing. Because I mean menus on sort of neat phones now that go all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do. I don't know how. I don't like the new phones that kind of got a windows based running system. I find it really confusing. I kept getting lost in the phone. I've not got a new one but my friend got a new one. And I'm trying to do things with it. And I just kept getting lost. But that's just me. Yeah. I don't know how for 25 or 12 euros 50 how much of an excellent screen you could get. You'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white LCD thing.  For the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for a large print, like you do in large print books. Obviously it displays less on the screen, it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing. What about kind of a dual function in that you've got the basic buttons just for your play volume program things. And also a menu to go into with obvious pictures, obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that. The other thing is just tucking into mobile phone design features again. You could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the flip over. I think that's a cost thing. I don't know how much we're going to know about. It might save a bit of space instead of looking bulkier, it might look small. It might have some cost implications. And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone. It can still be lightweight plastic, you know, something that's easily molded and produced. Sorry, I'm trading on your territory guys. Right, okay, we've got half an hour for the next meeting so we're all going to go off and do our individual things. I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and do it again. And I get to do another fantastic presentation. Just a quick thing about the, what you're saying about the, doesn't need to be fashionable. So I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the, we put the fashion into electronics. I think the whole design thing might be hard to find. Sure. You can still have plastic and it looks quite good. Yeah, I mean it doesn't have to be, that, you know, that was my main point. We do have to use metal. I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper, I presume it would. Yeah, yeah. I mean the sky remote controls have, they're kind of molded and look a bit different than the telewest remote control. So the plastic looks a bit smarter. So yeah, I guess that's the stuff. Okay. So let's break up there. Okay. Okay. So see you in half an hour. Do we go back to our, our, our things? Yeah. \n"]}],"source":["import whisper\n","\n","model = whisper.load_model(\"base\")  # choose 'tiny' if GPU is slow\n","full_text = \"\"\n","\n","for i in range(len(chunks)):\n","    result =
